### About the App

For analyzing your data, we provide two dictionaries for incivility in German-language online discussions. Use the app to find uncivil words in your uploaded data file. The app will add two new columns to your data - one column including the number of matches and one column including the matched strings. The python-based web-app runs in your browser (we recommend Firefox) without installing any software on any operating system. The app is hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
