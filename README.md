### About the App

The app can be used to identify uncivil words in German-language online discussions. The drag-and-drop data analysis is very easy to execute - no coding needed! For analyzing your data, we provide two dictionaries for incivility in German-language online discussions. The python-based web-app runs in your browser (we recommend Firefox) on any operating system without installing any software. The app is hosted by [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
